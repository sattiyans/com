    content: "From the first moment that Sattiyan came to DMC, I knew right away that he would make a good fit for the team. And true enough, he quickly adapts to our work environment. He got along well with all the colleagues. He has shown nothing but growth throughout his entire journey as a developer at DMC. He is also a quick learner and able to correct his mistakes in a timely manner, if any. He is also very proactive and quick to finish tasks on hand till the point where all tasks were 'sapu-ed' by him. That's where he earned the title 'Super Sattiyan' among the colleagues. It was a pleasure working with him, although our path was cut short, but our good memories remain. Looking forward to work with him again in the future if given the chance."
