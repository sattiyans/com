## Overview

Ravage is a labyrinth or maze genre game featuring First Person View (FPV) camera mode. This puzzle game challenges players to navigate through complex mazes, solve puzzles, and find their way to the exit.

As a Game Developer, I developed this project focusing on maze generation, navigation mechanics, and creating an immersive first-person experience that keeps players engaged while solving spatial puzzles.

## Features

- **First Person View**: Immersive FPV camera mode for navigation
- **Maze Generation**: Procedurally generated or hand-crafted maze layouts
- **Puzzle Elements**: Challenging puzzles integrated into the maze experience
- **Navigation Challenges**: Complex maze layouts that test spatial awareness and problem-solving skills

## Tech Stack

- **Unity**: Game engine with first-person controller capabilities
- **C#**: Programming language for maze generation, navigation logic, and puzzle mechanics

## Development Experience

Developing a maze game with first-person perspective required careful attention to camera controls, player movement, and spatial design. The project involved implementing smooth first-person controls, creating engaging maze layouts, and ensuring the gameplay remains challenging yet fair. This project taught me the importance of level design in puzzle games and how camera perspective affects player experience.

## Conclusion

Ravage demonstrates my ability to create engaging puzzle games with first-person mechanics. The project showcases skills in level design, spatial puzzle creation, and understanding how camera perspective impacts gameplay experience in maze-based games.
